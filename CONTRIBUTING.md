# Contributing to HowTravel

We would love for you to contribute to HowTravel and help make it even better
than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you
to follow:

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
